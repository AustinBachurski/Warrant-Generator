# WarrantGenerator

This application was written to aid my police department in generating search warrants. It allows the officer to simply enter in the pertinent information for the warrant and avoid having to type out a bunch of boilerplate, or risk incorrect data being included where content was copy/pasted from previous search warrants. The tool can produce both the Search Warrant Application document and the Search Warrant document itself for many of the common warrants that are issued. This greatly reduces wait time for the warrant to be issued, especially in the case of a barricaded suspect.
